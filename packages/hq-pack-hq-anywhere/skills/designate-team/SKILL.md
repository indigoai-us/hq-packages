# /designate-team

Designate one local `companies/{slug}/` directory as an HQ Pro team workspace by
setting `cloud: true` in `companies/{slug}/company.yaml` (an HQ Desktop App marker), then
delegating cloud provisioning to the canonical CLI subcommand
`hq cloud provision company <slug>`.

**Company slug:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## Rules

- Refuse `personal`; personal sync is auto-provisioned per-user.
- Validate the slug is non-empty and uses only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`.
- Validate `companies/{slug}/` exists locally (deeper validation — manifest
  membership, archived status — happens inside the CLI subcommand).
- Write `cloud: true` to `companies/{slug}/company.yaml` idempotently. This is
  an **HQ Desktop App marker** that `provision.rs::provision_missing_companies()` reads
  to discover cloud-eligible companies. The CLI subcommand writes
  `.hq/config.json` + patches `manifest.yaml` but does NOT touch `company.yaml`.
- Delegate manifest patching, vault entity creation, S3 bucket provisioning, and
  initial sync to `hq cloud provision company <slug>`. The CLI emits one line of
  structured JSON to stdout on success (or partial success on exit code 3).
- If `hq` is not on `PATH`, print the exact subcommand for the user to run later
  and exit 0 (company.yaml has been written; remaining work is recoverable).
- Echo the active HQ environment (vault URL, Cognito pool domain, current
  operator) before calling the CLI. This catches "wrong userpool" / "wrong
  vault" surprises early and works for every HQ user — no owner-specific paths.
- After the CLI succeeds, run a `GET /membership/me` self-check against the
  vault API the CLI just used. If the new `cloud_uid` is present in the
  response, the company will appear in the HQ console for the current operator.
  This is the same endpoint the console calls, so a green check here is a
  deterministic guarantee of console visibility.
- After the CLI succeeds, write the baseline member grants: `@all write` on
  each of `knowledge/*`, `projects/*`, `policies/*`, `skills/*` as four separate
  shared-folder prefix grants (`hq files share '<prefix>/*' --with @all
  --permission write --company {slug}`). Never a bucket-wide `*` grant. A
  trailing slash without `*` is the private create-only pattern, so do not use
  it for recursive baseline access. Members hold no implicit
  file access (only owner/admin bypass the ACL walk), so without these rows a
  member cannot push the knowledge they create or pull what teammates wrote.
  A failed grant is a warning with the exact re-run command, not a hard exit.
  Narrow it afterward with `/team-access` when a folder mixes shared and
  private material. `ontology/`, `signals/`, and `sources/` are never in the
  baseline; the ontology worker grants them per audience.
- Append one JSONL audit row to `workspace/learnings/designate-team-runs.jsonl`
  capturing the structured result from the CLI plus the `membership_visible`
  flag from the self-check.
- Exit codes: 0 success | 1 vault/auth | 2 invalid input | 3 sync failed
  (entity provisioned) | 4 provisioned but membership self-check failed
  (entity exists but operator can't see it — likely a userpool/token mismatch).

## Implementation

Run this from the HQ root:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

  echo "Usage: /designate-team <company-slug>" >&2
  exit 2
fi

  echo "ERROR: personal is out of scope for /designate-team" >&2
  exit 2
fi
case "$slug" in
  *[!A-Za-z0-9._-]*)
    echo "ERROR: invalid company slug '$slug'" >&2
    exit 2
    ;;
